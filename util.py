A Python module for interacting with OpenAI's GPT models and managing settings.

This module includes classes for managing settings and interacting with OpenAI's GPT models.

Classes:
- `Settings`: A class for managing settings using Pydantic's BaseSettings.
- `GPT_Wrapper`: A class for interfacing with OpenAI's GPT models.

NOTE:

This code below is pivotal, especially in scenarios like `streamlit run`, where the Pydantic class BaseSettings might encounter difficulties loading environment variables.

The specific process within the code ensures the loading of these variables from the `.env` file.
This code segment employs the BaseSettings class from Pydantic to define settings, like the OPENAI_API_KEY.

The snippet also incorporates the loading of environment variables from the `.env` file, critical for scenarios where Pydantic may struggle with this process, ensuring smooth functionality, particularly in applications like streamlit run.
