Next, we'll walk to my place, passing the gorgeous Fonte Luminosa, at Alameda, one of the most iconic fountains in Lisbon, where pastéis de nata will be waiting. After the tasting... It's time to cook. For the next couple of hours, you'll learn how to prepare several traditional Portuguese dishes. All of this in the company of an unavoidable glass of red or white wine, coming directly from our best producers. In the end, we'll all sit at the table and have fun, while tasting all of what has just been made... Appetizers, main dish and a delicious traditional dessert. And once again, wine will be present.

O Centro de Artes e Criatividade (CAC) de Torres Vedras centra-se no Carnaval, dando a conhecer as expressões artísticas de uma celebração assinalada um pouco por tudo o mundo. A exposição permanente Carnaval: Ritos, Artes e Criatividade mostra uma multiplicidade cultural que tem como denominador comum o Carnaval e onde não podiam faltar a história, as artes e os protagonistas do Carnaval de Torres Vedras. Centrando o seu conteúdo e atividade no Carnaval, este equipamento pretende promover o desenvolvimento das práticas artísticas e da criatividade como formas de inclusão social, com reflexos positivos no sentimento de pertença junto das comunidades da Encosta de São Vicente e da cidade de Torres Vedras. Tendo em conta a crescente importância social e económica do Carnaval de Torres Vedras, o Centro de Artes e Criatividade pretende, ainda, promover a inovação, o empreendedorismo e o desenvolvimento do tecido económico local. Paralelamente o CAC tem o propósito de inventariar, documentar e preservar o seu acervo, nomeadamente salvaguardar e divulgar o espólio documental e artístico relacionado com o Carnaval de Torres Vedras e as temáticas a ele associadas. Visa recolher e salvaguardar os testemunhos materiais (e imateriais) do Carnaval de Torres Vedras enquanto património coletivo, designadamente criando um repositório de memórias da comunidade sobre o Carnaval local. Procura ainda estabelecer parcerias e/ou redes nacionais e internacionais com universidades e/ou instituições museológicas ligadas ao Carnaval e às suas artes, contribuindo para o seu estudo e divulgação.","10:00 AM - 6:00 PM","","Rua Leonel Trindade, Torres Vedras 2560-612 Portugal","5.0","1 review","1","0","0","0","0"

Years later, with the inauguration of the Casa de Cultura da Malveira , on January 16, 2004, this estate was subjected to a process of museological rehabilitation and transferred to this culturally shaped space, more suitable for housing the objects that belonged to Beatriz Costa. Thus, in this spirit, a new dynamic was given to the present illustrative exhibition, under the title Beatriz Costa: the saliva diva. This estate is a testament to his love for his people and consists of some personal objects, travel memories, offers from friends and admirers from all walks of life, as well as a substantial documentary part","","Duration: 1-2 hours","Centro Cultural da Malveira, Largo da Feira, Mafra 2640-428 Portugal","5.0","1 review","1","0","0","0","0"

The ""Café Luso"", Fado House and Restaurant, is located within a solid and austere area, the former cellars and stables of the Palace Brito Freire, also known as Palace of St. Roque. The decorative patrimony includes the ceramic panels by Master Ferreira da Silva (1960's) and more recently the paintings of acrylic on canvas by Mr. Norberto Nunes. The ""Café Luso"" fulfils daily its destiny: to combine the sensibility and taste of the artistic and gastronomic talents, by permanently paying attention to its main aim , to preserve and innovate, making sure that stimulates and keep a cohesive Team, both skilful and creative. Being the Fado a tradition that cannot be translated, the Café Luso summons all those who visit us to return and feel the sounds of the Portuguese Soul.","7:30 PM - 2:00 AM","","Travessa da Queimada 10 Bairro Alto, Lisbon 1200-365 Portugal","3.0","432 reviews","98","107","89","50",""

As well as supplying neighbours with groceries, she was known for providing great conversation, with customers often staying for hours to catch up on the latest news and gossip. Today, our produce may have changed, but the relaxed, traditional atmosphere has stayed the same (which is why we kept the name). We’re proud to have stayed true to our roots.

In the Fado, Amalia Rodrigues proved her affection to this House with two yearly galas; the charismatics Alfredo Marceneiro and Fernando Mauricio came back many times. There are many to be named, but amongst those the interpreters Manuel Fernandes, Francisco Carvalhinho, Raul Nery, Adelino Santos, Beatriz da Conceicao, Maria Amelia Proenca, Maria da Fe and Mariza. The space was totally refurbished based on a new project, with a total preservation of the famous tiled facade and in the interior an area was created to display the large collection of historical images: paintings, drawings and photographs, property of the Machado Family. There is now an additional area, the Wine Cellar that serves traditional tidbits together with a large choice of Portuguese wines.","Closed until further notice","","Rua do Norte 91 Bairro Alto, Lisbon 1200-284 Portugal","3.5","435 reviews","0","0","0","0","0"

It's packed with lots of things to do with kids and the family, it takes the rush of getting airborne and adds a bunch of new dimensions – from aerial manoeuvres to slam dunking, wall running and dodgeball warfare. The best part is it doesn’t matter if you’re under 5 or an action sports junkie in training – you’re never too old or too young to have an awesome time. With almost 100 interconnected trampolines housed within huge, colourful spaces at a growing number of locations around Australia, BOUNCE is a spring-loaded urban playground with a wide range of things to do with kids; where hard surfaces are replaced with circus-grade sponge, giant air bags and springs. The rush of BOUNCE is infectious. Look around and everyone’s buzzing, whether they’re running up The Wall, launching into the Big Bag or loosening up in the Free Jump arena. It can be as easy or as challenging as you like – a training ground for aerial sports acrobatics, a place to kick back and look out over the action, or just a hard-core form of exercise that lets you burn energy without noticing you’re in the middle of a cardio workout. And our friendly staff are always there to offer safety tips and show you a few moves along the way. Check out the session times and book yourself in.

It is a vast and diversified heritage covering almost ten centuries of history and culture of the Portuguese society, encompassing all subjects and genres in ever growing library holdings. Thus securing a future for the past and building up a record of the present for the generations to come. The essence of the Library lies in this heritage. Kept alive and inspiring through the multiple forms of access enabled by technologies in constant renovation that convey farther than ever before, in a globalized world, the resources of our language, history and identity. Conservation, access and internationalization remain today, as in the past, the main lines of action in the management of the Institution, alongside increasing its social value by promoting initiatives convergent with the world of research. In this perspective, beyond the Library for the readers we also work towards the Library with the readers. The Library not confined to making content available, but envisaged as a platform for the creation and sharing of knowledge that offers an infrastructure for the participation of the community it serves.","9:30 AM - 7:30 PM","","Campo Grande 83, Lisbon 1749-081 Portugal","4.0","30 reviews","11","11","2","2",""

As a result of the parish’s resilience, whilst having the support of some individuals, it was possible to commence a preservation project for this valuable heritage, with its roof and exterior walls being improved during the process; some procedures were also carried out for the decorative painting of the church’s interior. With the increasing flow of tourism, the idea of opening the church on a permanent basis then emerged, as well as the intention to make it possible to visit the tower and, from that site, all who visit us can discover the most enchanting view of Lisbon over the Tejo's River.
