## Before Starting

üîë OpenAI API Key.
If you don't already have an OpenAI Key, it's essential to create one at <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>. This key is crucial for accessing OpenAI's services.
<br>
> Remember, it's vital to save this key securely and avoid sharing it because its use may incur costs.</font>

‚ö†Ô∏è It's a best practice to store your API key in a file named `.env`. This file should not be tracked by Git (add `.env` to `.gitignore` file), ensuring it remains private and inaccessible to others. Only you, within your local repository, should have access to this sensitive information.
